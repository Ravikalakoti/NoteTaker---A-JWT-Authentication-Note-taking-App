# Check Api Docs by http://localhost:8000/docs/

# Key Features:
1-User Registration and Login: Users can easily register an account with their email and password. The registration process is quick and straightforward, ensuring a hassle-free onboarding experience. Once registered, users can log in securely using their credentials.<br>

2-JWT Token Generation: Upon successful login, the application generates a JWT token that encapsulates user information and acts as a secure token for subsequent API requests. This token provides a stateless authentication mechanism, eliminating the need for traditional session-based authentication.<br>

3-Note Creation and Management: Authenticated users have the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete their notes. Users can create notes with titles and content, making it convenient to organize and categorize their thoughts and information.

4-Token Refresh Mechanism: The application incorporates a token refresh mechanism that enables users to obtain a new JWT token without the need for re-entering their login credentials. This feature enhances user experience and provides continuous access to the application's features.

5-Robust API Endpoints: NoteTaker's RESTful API provides well-defined endpoints for user registration, login, note creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. Each API endpoint adheres to REST principles, promoting a clear and standardized way of interacting with the application.

Development Stack:

# Backend: Django Rest Framework (DRF) with Python<br>
